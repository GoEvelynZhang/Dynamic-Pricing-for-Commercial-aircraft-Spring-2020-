### Abstract

Efficient aircraft valuation and prediction are vital for Aircraft Ap- praisers, as well as other participants of the aviation industry. However, the monopolistic industry feature, pre-established theoretical valuation approaches, and lack of data transparency hindered the application of a quantitative modeling approach towards aircraft valuation. This project targets at solving those issues by pooling data from multiple sources such as reports from FAA, OEMs, Airlines, and Appraisers. Through a quantitative exploration of multiple models, including the Ridge Regression Model, the Random Forest Model, the XGBoost Model, this project eventually attains a Stacking Model, with Training_mse of 0.02145 and Testing_mse of 0.02159 (on Log(Base Value)/1 million dollar).
